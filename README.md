# Sift Installation

Installation follows the standard ExpressionEngine addon install method. Sift consists of a _module_ and an _extension_.

## EE2.x Installation

* Upload the sift folder to your system/expressionengine/third_party/ folder
* In your EE control panel go to Addons > Modules. Click Install on the Sift row.
* Installation is done. Nothing to it. Visit [Sift Usage](http://squarebit.co.uk/sift/docs/usage#content)

*Note:* To use Sift you'll also need Matrix installed and setup on your site
