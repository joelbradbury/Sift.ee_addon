Using PayPal Express requires that you have a verified PayPal Business account. If you have not upgraded your personal account to a business account, you can do so at the following URL: <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_product-go&product=additional_payment">Upgrade to a business account here.</a></p> 
		<p>Please note: PayPal only displays shipping addresses on their payment capture page. If a shipping address is captured on your site, it will be sent to PayPal. If a shipping address is not captured on your site, the billing address will be assumed to be the shipping address and will be sent to PayPal instead.</p>
