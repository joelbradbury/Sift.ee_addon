<h2>FAQ</h2>


<h3>What about General searches?</h3>
<p><strong>Sift</strong> is designed to be used for filtering down data held in matrix fields. If you're looking for a more general search facility, try <a href="http://solspace.com/super_search">SuperSearch</a> or <a href="http://gotolow.com/low_search">Low Search</a>.</p>

<h3>What about third party fields?</h3>
<p>If you're using the <strong>sift:form</strong> tag to populate a list of possible cell options <strong>Sift</strong> will inspect the database for possible cell values. Native fields like text and textarea work perfectly here. Also supported are fields, like <a href="http://pixelandtonic.com/divebar">P&amp;T Checkboxes</a> and <a href="http://pixelandtonic.com/divebar">P&amp;T Select</a>.</p>

<p>If you've got a third party fieldtype you need support for, send a request to <a href="mailto:sift@squarebit.co.uk">sift@squarebit.co.uk</a> and we'll be able to add support for you no problem!</p>
