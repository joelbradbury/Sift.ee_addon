<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>What can I do with <strong>Sift</strong>?</p>

<p><strong>Sift</strong> gives you amazing search and filter powers on your matrix fields.</p>

<h3>It's Search, for Matrix Fields</h3>

<p><strong>Sift</strong> searches your matrix fields for content, then returns <em>only</em> those rows. When you search with sift the results you get back are just the entries and row data that matches.</p>

<h3>Free Your Product Data</h3>
<p>Have a product site that keeps options in matrix fields? How about only showing user's the fields that are relevant to them instead? You can use <strong>Sift's</strong> <a href="/sift/docs/hardcoded-searches#content">template tags to hardcode direct searches and filter down rows directly</a>.</p>

<h3>Focused, Quick</h3>
<p><strong>Sift</strong> lets you narrow down your results to only those that matter. All of the normal standard EE entry tags and matrix field tags work just as you'd like.</p>

<h3>Show Your Options</h3>
<p>How about displaying the possible options for a matrix column in a select field? <strong>Sift's</strong> <a href="/sift/docs/tags#tag-form">:form tag</a> lets you populate your forms with options of valid values direct from your matrix data. No more guessing.</p>

<h2>Sift Does More</h2>
<p>With sift you can do lots more than just basic matrix searching. <a href="/sift/docs/examples#content">Check out the examples to get an idea of what you can do</a>.</p>


<h4>Don't Need Matrix Searching?</h4>
<p><strong>Sift</strong> is for searching and filtering your matrix field data. It doesn't search standard entry data beyond the basic native EE field searching. For entry data searches we'd recommend using <a href="http://solspace.com/super_search">SuperSearch</a> or <a href="http://gotolow.com/low_search">Low Search</a>.</p>
